    "This is the first of what we hope will be a series of posts showing how to use Python for weather analysis and create graphics for a variety of purposes. In this two-part post, we demonstrate plotting a water vapor satellite image, specifically using GINI formatted data. GINI is the format currently used for satellite data transmitted across NOAAPORT, and is available on Unidata's [demonstration THREDDS server](http://thredds.ucar.edu/thredds/]). This first part focuses on accessing the data using [Siphon](http://siphon.readthedocs.org) and [MetPy](http://metpy.readthedocs.org); the second part will introduce plotting using [CartoPy](http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/). To whet your appetite, though, here is a sample of what we'd like to produce:\n",

Navigating here, we see a large collection of different satellite datasets. We're interested in looking at water vapor imagery, so the \"Water Vapor (6.5 / 5.7 um)\" link seems most useful. We'll dig further in by navigating into \"EAST-CONUS_4km\" and then \"current\", so that we can look at current full CONUS (CONtiguous US) images from GOES East."
